=item $text = $t->splitText($offset);

Breaks this node into two nodes at the specified I<offset>, keeping both in the tree as siblings. After being split, this node will contain all the content up to the I<offset> point. A new node of the same type, which contains all the content at and after the I<offset> point, is returned. If the original node had a parent node, the new node is inserted as the next sibling of the original node. When the I<offset> is equal to the length of this node, the new node has no data.

I<Returns>: the new node, of the same type as this node.

C<GDOME_INDEX_SIZE_ERR>: Raised if the specified I<offset> is greater than the number of characters in data.

C<GDOME_NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR>: Raised if this node is readonly.
